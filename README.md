# Ready to work with data science using Python

In this home GitHub, four approaches of data science are mainly focused on:

- Machine learning
- Deep learning

For each subject, basic Python codes were developed on a public dataset. The findings were presented on the PowerPoint slides attached. 
This could help beginners start working with data science.
