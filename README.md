# 1. Start to work with data science using Python

In this home GitHub, four approaches of data science are mainly focused on:

- Machine learning
- Deep learning
- Natural language processing
- Image processing 

For each subject, basic Python codes were developed on a public dataset. The findings were presented on the PowerPoint slides attached. 
This could help beginners start working with data science. 

# 2. How data science benefits business and scientific research

Let's learn and find out together how data science benefits business and research.

To answer this question, we just need to work with data, such as through exploratory data analysis and building predictive models. 
From the insights, we can see trends and correlations between variables in the data. 
Then the models help us predict the future trend based on the current dataset.
